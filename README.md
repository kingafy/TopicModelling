# Machine-Learning-In-Law
This project explores the use of ML in the legal sector.

1. A legal document is provided in pdf format. Usually multiple pages.
2. The function extracts the texts in the legal document (it can be modified to extract images too but this is beyond the scope of this work)
3. A series of fucntions utilizes list comprehensions and regex to clean the texts.
4. (a.) Topic modelling is carried out on the clean texts to extract subject-matter and themes of the document using LatentDirichletAllocation (LDA).
   (b.) A soft-text summarization is also carried out, supported by wordcloud display.
